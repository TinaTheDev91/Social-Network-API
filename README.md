# Social-Network-API
18 NoSQL (MongoDB)

## Description

This application was created to show my ability to utilize the backend database known as MongoDB. At this point in time, we are focused on efficient backend programming. Given my background in SQL, data/database management, I have learned that backend programming is where I thrive. Through this project, I was able to grasp the amount of possibilities there are as a backend developer.

This project's goal was to create a social media API that utilizes MongoDB for data storage. It features multiple GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes across 3 tables with built in relationships that utilize virtuals to create links and associations.

## Installation

This project is only accessible by downloading the repository and running the routes via your preferred API tool (such as Insomnia or Postman). 

## Usage

When using the application, the data you see should resemble what's pictured below after creating your own seeds. If you encounter errors, or see an output that doesn't resemble, please email me at TinaTheDev91@gmail.com.
